Eustace, age 21, is a junior computer science student in Charlotte. He excels in his classwork but lacks real-world experience in his field. 
He's looking to build his professional skills and his resume. He has met with peers before to practice mock interviewing but would like a more 
professional way to meet with skilled people to guide him. He wants an app that can schedule meetings to meet with these kinds of people.

Jordan, age 18, is a freshman chemistry student at Charlotte. He hopes to find a passion for learning and wants to take steps towards a 
successful career. He is open to connecting with students and would like to join a club. Since he's a freshman he's unfamiliar with all 
the different resources he has available. He would like to be able to find career tips, resources, and information in one spot. 
He would specifically like resources that linked him to finding extracurricular activities to build his portfolio and resume.

Sarah, age 29, is a graduate Computer Science student from Charlotte. She did not engage in anything other than her classwork which she was
great at. Because of her lack of experience, it has been hard for her to find a job in the field. Unfortunately, the resources that help 
guide students in their careers are typically locked behind a Niner account. She wants to find something that can help provide her 
resume-building guidance, connect with people to perform mock interviews, and be an easy way to connect with companies for basic work experience.
