Scenarios:

- Ricky, age 42, is a former student of UNCC who has returned to school to finish his degree. He has recently switched his major from Biology to Computer Science and would like to change his current career field from business administration to something in tech that will allow him to work remotely from home. He is familiar with computing but has no portfolio or formal education to represent his abilities. Although he knows he wants to work in computing he does not have a clear idea about the specific types of jobs or career paths he can acquire with a CCI degree. 


- Cynthia, age 43, is a graduate of UNCC with a degree in Biology who has returned to school to supplement her education by earning a second degree in Computer Science degree. She works full-time health care worker at a local hospital and would like to advance her career by learning the tech skills needed to pursue higher paying positions within her company. Having a scientific background she is driven by logic and data and believes this mindset will allow her to have a fairly smooth transition into learning about computing and informatics. Although she is unsure of which careers/jobs will become available to her with a second degree in Computer Science she knows it will open previously unavailable opportunities for prosperity and career advancement. 


- Ahsoka, age 19, is a transfer student from out of the country. She has recently been terminated by her former employer where she worked very closely with military intelligence officials in war torn areas and has decided to pursue a new career as a computer scientist. She is interested in developing applications that can help feed the needy while also providing necessary items and services for those who may be struggling to survive. She wants to bring positivity to the world and believes if she earns a Computer Science degree that she can utilize her new skills to bring about change while making the world a better place for everyone.
