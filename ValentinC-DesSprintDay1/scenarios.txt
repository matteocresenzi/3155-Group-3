Emily is 20 years old computer science student, after several meetings with her career advisor, 
she is still confused about what career path she should follow. She enjoys coding and playing games, 
but Cyber Security sounds very interesting too. Her career advisor told her that she can’t go wrong 
with either concentration, but that advice did not help Emily with her decision. 
Emily found this app where there is a community of students that help each other 
answering questions about different concentrations. Additionally, Emily has been 
able to upload her code and review other student’s code. Emily has decided to concentrate 
on game development.
